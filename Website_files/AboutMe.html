           <h1><span style="color:#E5A613"><b>Welcome</b> to the <b>About Me</b> section. Here, you will be able to find information about my player in Monkey Quest.</h1>
           <h2><span style="color:GREEN">I made this section in honor of my player in Monkey Quest, and you might learn new stuff about me that you didn't know earlier.</h2>
           <h3><span style="color:#80BFFF">My player's name was Hooper Crookedtrip. I created him on December 17th, 2011, although he wasn't my first player to this game; my first player was Seeno Jungleblossom, a very old player from April 2011. Let's return back to Hooper; 2011 and especially 2012 were the best years of Monkey Quest and I enjoyed playing with Hooper very much. In 17th December, 2012, exactly a year after I started playing the game, I reached level60. But then, the 2013 update came, and ruined the game! And also, 5 more levels were added; those 5 levels were my worst experience in the game, because I didn't have a Membership in this time... All I was able to do to level up was to compete in the warrior games, against myself. Can you imagine this? FIVE WHOLE LEVELS! For every run I got very less EXP, but I had enough patience to level up and finally get to level65! When this happened, I was very happy! And then came the most important part of the game for me: I met a very cool and rare girl player- Lillian Coolorb... She had sooooo much cool and rare stuff, like noone other had! She had proven herself to be the Queen of Monkey Quest (that's my opinion). She is the one who invented the style of wearing one sort of plate armor, shield, pants, bracers and tail ring, and wearing the Mysterious Hood and the Tricorn Of The Deep that just came out... after she got banned by a stupid player who reported her, I just copied her style, but changed it a bit; instead of wearing Chim Foo plates, I was wearing Sea Dragons plates. And somewhen in this period I started to be famous and popular among players all over Ook. This is my story. Now, I'm going to show you some pictures of my player in Monkey Quest. Here they are:<br/><br/><img src="HooperTheGreat.jpg"><br/><br/><img src="MyHandsomeHooper.png" <br/><img src="Hoop&kiki.png" <br/><br/><img src="HoopRocks.png" <br/><br/><img src="VespidFALLS.png" <br/><br/><img src="FoulbreathFALLS.png" <br/><br/><img src="Hoop&Russell.png" <br/><br/><img src="Hoop&Russell2.png" <br/><br/><img src="Hooper&Kiki2.png" <br/><br/><img src="Hooper&Glider.png"      </ul>
