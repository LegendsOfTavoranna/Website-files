           <h2><span style="color:GREEN">The Legend Of Monkey Quest</h2>
           <h3><span style="color:#80BFFF">Long ago, before monkeys, Ook was a very different place, where a lot of fantastic creatures were giant beasts, thrown in the land, and magic was everywhere. in time, these creatures became rarer, and in the end, they were replaced by the animals we know today. In early days, most monkeys were...umm...how do u say it...? Not so clever. except for one: the Monkey King! yes, HE was magnificent... he roared like a lion, swam like a fish, and flew like an eagle! He taught his monkey brothers and sisters to swing from the trees and perhaps, more importantly, he taught them to find BANANAS! Yes, and for this, and for all the other things he has done to them, they made him their new king! But at last, his appetite for knowladge and thirst for adventure could not be satisfied, so he decided to leave the jungle and his beloving monkey friends, to see the world. On his travels, the Monkey King met five brave companions. They became best friends, together, they explored ancient runes, battled strange creatures and discovered powerful magic. Of course, monkeys and magic aren't always the best mix, and...something dread can happen... no, not that...but that looks incomfortable...
An ancient evil returned to the world, the Shadow Demon Ka. Ka, who was raiding places across the land, destroying all that was good! The Monkey King and his companions battled Ka and his shadow monster army for many years...In the epic final battle, Ka swallowed the Monkey King, but something in the last of his powers, shuttered Ka's black core into a million shadow shards! Ka was gone, but suddenly, so was the Monkey King. The companions, eventually set into remote ereas of Ook, forming the five original monkey tribes. At this moment, monkeys from all tribes are gathering at the Crossroads city to investigate strange new events in the nearby jungle. Will you be the next hero of ook? We shall see...<br/><br/><iframe width="650" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/datjcZzjDeU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></h3>        </ul>
