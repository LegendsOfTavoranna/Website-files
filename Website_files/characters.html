           <h2><span style="color:GREEN"><font size="4.5">Chapter 1: "The Explosion"</h2>
           <h3><span style="color:#80BFFF">It was a normal day in Ook. I (Hooper) was hunting dreadful monsters in the depth of the shard carvens, as usual for every morning training. After I defeated all the monsters in my sixth arena for that day, I ran quickly to the surprise chest in order to get my prizes for beating the arena. I stood near the chest and opened it, but there were no items in there... instead, I got sucked into it... Eveyrthing became dark... Seconds later I was able to see again. I found myself in a room! I noticed that I'm standing on a floor made of Shadow Shards. -Where the heck am I- I thought to myself. I saw a piece of a glowing bamboo on the floor. I was totally confused... I took it in my hands to check what is it... suddenly my hands started glowing....then my arms...then my body, and finally my feet.... I felt a lot of pressure and shouted:"AHHHHHHH", and in the next second I was thrown back and the floor started cracking. then part of it shattered into pieces and fell down, as an enormous shadow emerged out of it. "FINALLY, IM FREE! MUWHAHAHAHA"- it was Ka who spoke. The shadow demon looked at my face. I was so scared that I peed in my pants... twice... then Ka continued-"Look, who's here, HOOPER CROOKEDTRIP. You were stupid enough to enter here and now, YOU WILL DIE!!!". Suddenly he took his shadowy huge arm and it hit the floor near me, which collapsed. I had to jump to the corner of the room to avoid falling down and finding my death. then I noticed something behind me. IT WAS THE CHEST! I knew what I had to do. I opened it as Ka prepared for another strike and got sucked into it back to the arena I defeated. everything started collapsing around me!!! With the bamboo piece that i found in the room, I started running the run of my life in hope to reach outside. Blocks were falling behind me and many of them almost hit me. I finally climbed outside and ran out of the Forgotten Temple. I looked to the sky. To my horror it was all purple... I ran as fast as I could to the portal that teleports to Crossroads Path. When I reached it, I took a last look on the falling temple... AND SUDDENLY IT EXPLODED!!! I was thrown towards Crossroads and in the next moment I found myself lying in the ruins of Magma Citadel. I was lying. All my body hurt. Slowly I got up on my feet. -Oh my god...- I thought to myself. The view was terrible. Whole Magma Citadel was in ruins. -I met Ka... KA IS BACK- I thought in panic and horror.... -He almost killed me-. Then suddenly I remembered that I completely forgot about something... the bamboo piece!! I started looking for it but luckily I found it in my hand... I walked slowly to the portal and teleported to Crossroads Path. I had never seen such a horrible sight. Crossroads was COMPLETELY destroyed, all the place was in ruins. I started passing my way when suddenly I heard a tiny voice: "help me, help....". I took the block that was lying next to me in my hands, and saw a body of girl. She was whispering: "Hoo....per.....he....help... hel...." But she didn't finish the sentence. Suddenly her eyes turned back and blood started pouring out of her opened mouth. I was looking at her body for some seconds, and then screamed to the sky: "CAAAAARMEEEEEEN""<br/><br/><br/><br/></h3>
         

           <div style="display:none"><h4><span style="color:GREEN"><font size="4.5">Chapter 2:"The Dead Survivour"</font></h4></div>
           <div style="display:none"><h5><span style="color:#80BFFF"><font size="4.5">I was so hopeless in those moments... She was Carmen Ultrawizard, who was my girlfriend in Monkey Quest. I screamed and cried for about 15 minutes. When I calmed down a little bit, I took Carmen's body and buried it in the Haunted Graveyard. While I was walking out I was sure that something was following me... I went outside and looked forward towards a figure that was about 150 meters away from me. I came closer and saw who it was. Flash! He was ALIVE!! I looked at him and yelled: "OH MY GOD!!! FLASH YOU SURVIVED!!!!". He turned back and I could see he was in shock. "Hooper!!!! You are alive!!!!"-He screamed. then he became really nervous and yelled: "WHAT THE HECK DID JUST HAPPEN??! I was training in the warrior games, having a competition with a friend of mine, when suddenly I was thrown up so high that I almost touched the clouds! And then I landed near the portal to the Underbelly... And somehow survived." I replied: "I think I have a very good explanation of what just happened...". I told Flash all what happened to me in the shard caverns and showed him the bamboo piece."Wow, so this tiny thing caused all of that?"-Said Flash in surprise. Then it suddenly stroke him-"Wait...WHAT??!! KA IS BACK??? OH MY GOD, WE GOTTA GET OUTTA HERE!!!"-He screamed, and I said:"AGREED, DUDE! Let's go and hide in Forest Ruins, I know some good spots there where we can hide... But something stopped us from running away. "Whew, it-t is s-so c-c-cold here....".- said Flash. I began to sense the cold too...We turned backwards... What we saw made us sigh with fear.... Then we heard the voice:" Where do you think you're going? leaving without me??" "CARMEN I DON'T BELIEVE! "-I shouted. but then we both looked at her strangely. It wasn't Carmen..... IT WAS CARMEN'S GHOST! Carmen was wearing her usual clothes, but we could look threw her, and she was floating in the air. I made some unsure steps towards her but then she said: "Relax, Hoop, I won't hurt you". "Im so sorry"- I said. "It's okay"- Carmen replied. It's hard to explain how I felt in those moments. A part of me was very very sad because Carmen died. But the other part of me was happy because at least I could communicate with her.... Then Flash woke me up:"AHHHHH GHOST!!!" But Carmen laughed and said:"I won't hurt you either, smartie". I told her everything that happened to me and Flash. Her reaction was the same as Flash's when she heard about Ka, except one thing. "We can't be so selfish, we gotta find more survivours!"-She said when I told her about our plan, to hide. "Speaking of survivours"-said Flash-"I forgot to mention something in my story of surviving this blast". Carmen and I looked at him as he continued:"when I was in the air, I could see a monkey who was also thrown away. He landed in the depts of the swamps in the area of the Ootu Mystics. I'm sure he was a boy. When he was in the air, a glider appeared in his hands and he started gliding down. That was the last thing I saw before I hit the ground. Then Carmen and I shouted: "WHO WAS THAT?? ?" And Flash answered: " I don't know, but he was wearing the ace pilot goggles, a King Of Fools Crown,  and..." Before he could finish the sentence I said:"I know the only person who dresses up like that!" And then I shouted: "SONIC!!!"<br/><br/><br/><br/></font></h5>
     

           <div style="display:none"><h6><span style="color:GREEN"><font size="4.5"><b>Chapter 3:"Ootu Mystics"</b></font></h6></div>
           <div style="display:none"><h7><span style="color:#80BFFF"><font size="4.5"><b>We ran as fast as we could to the Ootu Mystic's area. When we got there we saw a mess. Buildings were completely shattered on the ground; gigantic vines, which were cut and dead, were lying on the muddy floor; and the most terrifying thing: LOTS of dead bodies of monkeys.... The view of this disaster made me feel so broken... -Ka will pay for this...-I thought to myself. Carmen was the one who woke me up from my thoughts when she shouted:" OH MY GOD. WHAT HAD HAPPENED HERE???" I saw that Flash was shocked too. "WE GOTTA FIND SONIC!!!"- I screamed with a voice full of fear... who knows what happened to him... Then Carmen said:"Guys, I feel movement, over there!" and pointed towards Bog Bazaar. We ran there and went threw the portal. The sight made us sigh with relief and fear in the same time. Sonic was fighting green venomous bathogs. He had a sword in his right hand and the glider that Flash told us about in his left hand. "How did this glider just appear in his arms..."- I thought to myself. All of a sudden Sonic clapped his hands and a Feiry Kernel Blaster appeared in them! He blasted the bathogs until they all were defeated! We ran to him and Flash hugged his best friend and shouted : "WE FOUND YOU SONIC, YEAAAAAA". Then Sonic said:"Flash, Hooper, GHOST?? ?" He shouted in horror until I said:"Calm down bro, its Carmen Ultrawizard. She's our friend. She died because of the blast and now she is a ghost and....." I couldn't finish my sentence because Carmen shouted: "Wait a second guys, I feel that there is another person somewhere here.....no.....not a person.......". And then her eyes became wide open.  She whispered:" A ghost....", and pointed towards the swamps. At first we didn't see it, but then it came closer and we could see a girl's figure and feel that there was VERY VERY cold. We could hear Sonic's voice: "Stefanie......". Sonic looked at her in shock. She floated towards him and said:"Long time have passed, Sonic..." But he just asked: "Did you.....die? ". His face became pale as she answered: "Yes, Im sorry". Then She said: "You know, you are so sweet for being worried for me....". As she was saying this she floated closer to him, and kissed his cheek. Sonic looked at her. Then suddenly he hugged her and whispered:" I missed you, Steph...and.....I'm so sorry you died....May I know how?". Stefanie's answer made Flash throw up:"A giant vine flew towards me and it was so fast that when it hit me, it made my head disconnect from my body..." "Welcome to the club, girl. I died when a huge rock flew straight into my face and squeezed it..." "OH MY GOD."-Said Sonic, and continued-"Those are two horrible  ways to die..." Then stefanie replied to Sonic's words:"well, but not the worst ways...before I died I saw a monkey who got squeezed by a building that fell on him". Then it was MY turn to puke. Sonic asked her angrily:"Do you know about monkeys that DIDN'T DIE IN TERRIBLE WAYS???" And She answered:"Yes". Everyone looked at her and Flash shouted:"Well, TELL US MAYBE?" And she said:"Right. Ok. After I found myself out of my body I was venturing in this area to see if maybe anyone survived. I saw LOTS of dead bodies, but I couldn't feel any ghost..." "come to the point! " shouted everyone.  And Stefanie continued:" OK! ah.... well, I also saw a monkey who was alive.... but he was dying. Then he put his hands on his body, there was a big flash of light, and the injury in his belly just disappeared!". Then everyone shouted "where did you see him???". And Stefanie answered: "not far from here, in Mushroom Hollow.". We started running there right away. When we came there we saw a recognized person controlling green vines and and attacking monsters with them. We all shouted: "SEBASTIEN!! !!"<br/><br/><br/><br/></b></font></h7>
